Loaded LCTs are anchored overnight in the Solent, before mooring at Southampton. Men take the time to prepare artillery rounds for the "drenching fire". This is a fire plan to use the SPs to fire, while still off shore in their LCTs, onto the beaches just before the first wave of the QOR touches down. The heavy seas causes the rounds to land randomly, making it ineffective. Any rounds left minutes before the QOR are to land are heaved overboard into the sea.
