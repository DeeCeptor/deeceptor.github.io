Bill Grant abandons the SP that is stuck on the beach and begins to push into the town. First thing he films on getting over the seawall is the medic. The one place individuals are getting over the seawall in the immediate area is just left of the concrete barrier. The medic is likely just behind it. Grant later films wounded soldiers walking in this direction.
