The ramp is continually being built up as traffic squashes it. This is the third attempt at building a ramp. An SBG bridge was set down much further east, but went askew and could not be repositioned. A breach was made just east of the house, but the grade was too steep and the sand was unstable. Here there was a chance hole in the seawall made by the artillery and the height to be scaled was not too great. It is now the place of D-Day Memorial. You can see the LCIs are now landing re-enforcements. Lieutenant Gilbert Milne is on one of the LCIs and takes two photographs with his camera pointed towards Bill Grant.
