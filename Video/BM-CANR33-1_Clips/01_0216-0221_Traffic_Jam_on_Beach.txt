The SP Bill Grant is in does not move for some time and he continues to film from inside. You can see the spade grips for the M2 heavy machine gun in the foreground on the left. You can also see the concrete barrier that blocks the exit from the beach, just on the other side of the tank in the centre. The ramp to its right has just been started.
