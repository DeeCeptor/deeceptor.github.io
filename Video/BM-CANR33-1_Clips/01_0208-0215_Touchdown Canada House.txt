Bill Grant is filming from inside an SP of the 14 Field RCA. While Frank Dubervill's photograph of the "Maison des Canadiens" or the "Maison de Queen's Own Rifles of Canada" reaches newspapers first, the first moving image of liberated France is Grant's footage. No other footage of the beaches, save the footage of the North Shores at la Rive, reaches the public for another two days.
