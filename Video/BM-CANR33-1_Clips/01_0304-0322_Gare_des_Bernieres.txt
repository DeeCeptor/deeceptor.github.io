Prisoners are gathered on the platform of the Bernieres train station. The civilians have also been rounded up and placed by the station house. Field security worries that there may be collaborators among the civilians. One of the young men is Paul Martin. The civilians will be freed by the intervention of Sergeant Rosaire Gagnon of Le Régiment de la Chaudière.
