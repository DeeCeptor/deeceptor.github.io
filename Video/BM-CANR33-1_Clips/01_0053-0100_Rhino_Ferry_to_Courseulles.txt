LST is towing a "Rhino" ferry, little more than a raft with outboard motors and trailer ramps. This LST has Lieutenant Ken Bell taking photographs and Sergeant Al Grayston filming as they make their way to Courseulles-su-Mer. Note how heavy the seas are, the storm that caused the 24 hour delay to D-day has yet to pass.
