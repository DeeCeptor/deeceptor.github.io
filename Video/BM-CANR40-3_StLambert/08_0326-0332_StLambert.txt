Shot by Lloyd Millon from the CFPU jeeps parked by the side of the road. Captain Martin firing the Bren gun. This staff car can be seen just moments earlier swerving in the far right of the frame in 08_0352-0355_StLambert.mpg. Lieutenant D.I. Grant photographs Millon filming this in his frame 38880 DIG. I could not find a good scan of this, and 38881 DIG is similar but with Millon out of frame.
