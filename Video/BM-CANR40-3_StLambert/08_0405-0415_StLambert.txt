D.V.Currie is shown personally taking three Germans who have been hiding in a barn into custody. One young German officer wearing the overcoat and holds out his holstered pistol exited from the barn. The end shot shows the burnt out Sherman by the house with the collapse corner seen in Ian Grant's photograph, which suggest where the farm is. I wonder if these three were in the staff car that can be seen swerving behind the motorcycle as it approached the Canadians entering town?
