German motorcycle with officer can be seen through the windshields of the CFPU jeeps as it approaches the jeeps. The German staff car can be seen on the far right with a shadowy figure bailing out or falling out as it swerves. This is much more visible in the British Movietone newsreel. https://youtu.be/0R5fywulhQc?t=213
